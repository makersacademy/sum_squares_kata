## Quickstart

```
git clone git@github.com:makersacademy/sum_squares_kata.git
cd sum_squares_kata
bundle install
rspec
```

You should see something like:

```

     # delete this line and complete the test
     # ./spec/sum_squares_spec.rb:7

  2) SumSquares when #addSquares is called with 1 has a total of 1
     # delete this line and complete the test
     # ./spec/sum_squares_spec.rb:17

  3) SumSquares when #addSquares is called with 1 and then 2 has a total of 5

```

Go ahead and complete the tests to make them pass.

You should only need to change the spec file (`sum_squares_spec.rb`), not the
application file (`sum_squares.rb`)
